-- | A strong lax semi-monoidal endofunctor.
-- This is equivalent to an 'Applicative' without 'pure'.
--
-- Laws:
--
-- @
-- ('.') '<$>' u '<.>' v '<.>' w = u '<.>' (v '<.>' w)
-- x '<.>' (f '<$>' y) = ('.' f) '<$>' x '<.>' y
-- f '<$>' (x '<.>' y) = (f '.') '<$>' x '<.>' y
-- @
--
-- The laws imply that `.>` and `<.` really ignore their
-- left and right results, respectively, and really
-- return their right and left results, respectively.
-- Specifically,
--
-- @
-- (mf '<$>' m) '.>' (nf '<$>' n) = nf '<$>' (m '.>' n)
-- (mf '<$>' m) '<.' (nf '<$>' n) = mf '<$>' (m '<.' n)
